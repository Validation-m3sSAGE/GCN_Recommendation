To the east it disappeared into the flat treeless horizon of the estuary, merging into the earth just as the earth merged into the sea at the muddy edge of England. As it left London, this road, which in only a few years would become a highway, formed the northern boundary of a dreary region of swampy land. The great river, as it bent south then north again, formed the southern edge of this semicircle of marshland. It had been drained and flooded, drained and flooded half a dozen times in the previous fifty years, while England burned Protestants then Catholics and then Protestants again. This place could not seem to decide if it was of the river or of the earth. The ancient name for the misbegotten half-land was Wapping. No one could remember where the name came from. In recent years small wharves and little clusters of houses had appeared along the riverbank at Wapping. The rich men who funded the buildings decided that houses and wharves would do a better job of keeping out the river than the sea walls they\u2019d been building for decades in their vain attempts to reclaim the land from the waters. And, more to the point, a wharf generated more profit than a wall. During the days men made themselves busy around the dozens of boats that moored up along the wharves, the vessels settling down into the riverbed when the tide went out and rising again as it flooded back in, washing up against the wood-and-brick pilings. The pickings were not rich. London\u2019s most lucrative trade still headed further upstream toward the wharves that operated within the city walls, but a new gray economy was emerging here downstream at Wapping. Beyond this sliver of moneymaking and building, back behind the wharves, between the river and the road, were the marshes. The occasional flood still occurred, sweeping away families and livelihoods as well as the property of the men of business. This dank, oozing landscape, unpromising and undeveloped, was the result of the river\u2019s inundations. The ground was low, lower than sea level in some places, rising up to the bluff along which the road ran to the north. A man could stand there in the marshes, his feet sinking into the mud, and look to the backs of the wharves and warehouses along the river and imagine that they were floating on water. There was a gap in the riverside development, and in this gap stood a group of gallows. The gallows lived on borrowed time\u2014already there were complaints that this place of execution was dragging down the land value of investments. Could it not be moved downstream a bit, perhaps to Ratcliffe, somewhere benighted and undeveloped where men of business were not trying to attract custom? But for now the gallows still stood. On this midsummer\u2019s eve there were six river pirates hanging there. The gallows were right at the water\u2019s edge, set in among the wharves. The six unfortunates hanging from the ropes had been caught after leaping aboard a barge in the river. It had been their sixth attack in four weeks and it was to be their last. The local lightermen and watermen had banded together to bait a trap for them, putting out stories that a barge with wool intended for France and Spain would be traveling downstream that day. When the pirates had clambered onboard, a group of twenty river men hidden beneath sails had emerged and captured them, but sadly not before the pirates, or at least, reported most of the ambushers, the apparent captain of the pirates, whose knife had flashed more quickly and more viciously than those of his crew, had sent three of the Wapping lightermen into the embrace of the old river, their throats slashed and their eyes empty. Eventually the men overcame the pirates and after some cursory discussions with what passed for the authorities in this new outpost they decided upon a customary punishment. The pirates were hanged at Execution Dock, where they would be left for three tides as a signal to others (and perhaps an offering to the river) before being cut down and disposed of. The river was already rising for the first of these three tides when the leader of the pirates heard a clatter of hoofs on the mixture of mud and stones that constituted the main street here in Wapping, running along the curve of the river behind the wharves. A mighty carriage, it sounded like. The clatter stopped, and he heard the sound of a carriage door slamming. A few minutes later, some squelching footsteps as a man approached. The pirate kept his eyes prudently closed as the footsteps stopped, perhaps directly in front of him. Within two hours, the river would be up to the chins of the men on the gallows, before falling back again. Carefully, the pirate opened one eye halfway. He saw the swaying feet of his dead shipmates on either side of him, and opened the eye a little further. His visitor was standing on the foreshore, dressed in the Dutch style, all somber black and white, the clothes effortlessly wealthier than the new gay and gaudy fashions that were rippling out from the English Queen\u2019s court. The visitor cleared his throat and spat. The pirate heard a small splash in the water, and his careful eyes caught the sun as it glittered on a thick lump of green phlegm which appeared and spun around in the water as it commenced its journey down to Tilbury. The visitor glanced up and behind at the gallows, and the pirate closed his eyes quickly. He resolved to keep his eyes that way as the visitor started to speak, in rich aristocratic tones with just the hint of a clammy Dutch accent. \u201cQuite a view they\u2019ve given you. Desirable waterfront property, I\u2019d say.\u201d The pirate said nothing, obviously. The creaking of the gallows was the only sound as he and his men swung gently in the soft summer breeze. Miles and miles upstream, it was a beautiful evening among the willow trees and reeds at Runny\u00admede and Richmond, where the aristocrats played at court and love and wrote poetry to each other. The sun was setting in the opulent west. But here, to the east of the metropolis, the dominant colors were grays and browns. Mud and water, not trees and flowers. The thought seemed to make the visitor positively cheerful. He put his hands behind his back and actually rose up on his toes at the vista before him. \u201cSomeday all this will be very desirable property, captain. When my father built his wall here, he had a vision of a new suburb, with the river kept out and the land turned into meadows and orchards. He wanted this to be the prettiest part of London. And all within sight of that dreadful Tower.\u201d It occurred to the pirate to wonder why the Dutchman was speaking when, as far as the man knew, there was no one there alive to listen to him. The visitor spoke again, and even with his eyes closed the pirate captain had the impression that the Dutchman had turned his back on the river and was facing him. Almost as if he were speaking to him. Perhaps he was practicing an address. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the last, captain. The last crew to be hanged on this so-called Execution Dock. It\u2019s keeping the developers away, this grisly habit, and this land is valuable. A hundred years, maybe two hundred, this\u2019ll be the busiest port in the world. Trade is coming, captain. Trade. Not petty thievery or the ridiculous swapping of bits of unmade cloth for bits of food \u2019n\u2019 drink. The world\u2019s wealth is out there waiting to be bought and sold, and unlike most of my countrymen I predict that the buying and selling will happen here, in London, not in Antwerp or Rotterdam. Wapping\u2019s going to flourish. It\u2019s going to become the hub on which the world turns. You\u2019ll go down in history, captain. The last pirate to be hanged at Wapping. My congratulations.\u201d Another movement, and then the sound of the visitor walking back to his carriage. The slamming door, the \u201chai!\u201d of the coachman, and the snap of hoofs and wheels on the road back into London. And then only the sound of the creaking gallows again. The tide rose, and later it fell. It rose and it fell three times. When the locals came to cut them down, they were disconcerted to find only five pirates hanging from the gallows. The sixth\u2014the captain\u2014had gone.

There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn.

Through the years this community has endeavored to carry out its mission to \u201cprovide mutual support, self-help, advocacy and education, information, and referral services to individuals who have experienced significant problems in their lives due to a mental illness\u2014and who acknowledge this; and to advocate for positive changes within the traditional mental health system.\u201d At different stages On Our Own has emphasized different aspects of this mission. The main thing OOO had done over its lifetime is to provide a community of mutual support among peers who join together to support one another on the path to recovery. Out of these relationships, which include a lot of careful and respectful listening, individual and group needs are identified, and plans are made and carried out to meet the various needs that members bring on their road to recovery and robust wellbeing. While this process has sometimes been highly structured and intentional, and at other times informal and less conscious, it has been the same core process that was reaffirmed over and over in different forms with different language and labels over the years: caring. This book shares the things On Our Own learned along the way. Its purpose is to help others form their own organizations, helping people with mental health challenges build caring places of community and mutual growth. In this book you will find tools to develop such an organization, along with a dose of On Our Own's history so that you might learn from its mistakes and successes as you create your own unique healing community."], "description": ["About the Author", "Alice Anderson is the current President of the Board of Directors of On Our Own of Charlottesville.

The rediscovered book launched a primitivist myth that captivated admirers over the next 500 years, from Martin Luther to Heinrich Himmler, who loved its portrayal of ancient Germans as freedom-loving warriors, uncultured but honorable, in contrast to decadent Romans. In fact, Tacitus probably never visited Germany, Krebs notes. Rather, using books and travelers' reports, he wrote for a Roman audience who shared his romantic view of northern barbarians. Enthusiastic German readers, culminating in the Nazis, ignored Tacitus's disparaging comments, misread passages to confirm their prejudices, and proclaimed that the ancient historian confirmed their national superiority. This is an inventive analysis of, and warning against, an irresistible human yearning to find written proof of one's ideology. Illus. (May) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

They often need to set up database systems and are responsible for making sure those systems are actually running efficiently. They also need to ensure that the data is backed up regularly, stored effectively, and that the data is highly secure. One will very likely run SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server 2012. There is the new SQL Server 2012 exam coded 70-462 that covers these topics: Install and Configure, Maintain Instances and Databases, Optimize and Troubleshoot, Manage Data, Implement Security, Implement High Availability. Exam 70-432, on the other hand, is all about configuring SQL Server 2008 R2. The topics covered include: Installing and Configuring SQL Server 2008 Maintaining SQL Server Instances Managing SQL Server Security Maintaining a SQL Server Database Performing Data Management Tasks Monitoring and Troubleshooting SQL Server Optimizing SQL Server Performance Implementing High Availability Your job may require that you master both SQL Server versions. SQL Server 2008R2 and SQL Server 2012 share many common features and mechanisms. The two exams have BOKs that look quite different. However, the actual knowledge items involved do overlap a lot so it actually makes sense to study both together. Throughout this book we use screen captures made out of SQL Server 2012. However, unless the text explicitly states a specific version, the contents can be applied towards both versions. We give you knowledge information relevant to the exam specifications. To be able to succeed in the real exams, you\u2019ll need to apply your earned knowledge to the question scenarios. Many of the exam questions are written to be less straight forward. They tend to be framed within the context of short scenarios. The exams are not too difficult. However, coverage is very comprehensive \u2013 a wide range of topics are presented in the official topic lists. The exams do not ask you to answer hundreds of questions. In other words, only a small fraction of the official topics will be presented. This ExamFOCUS book focuses on the more difficult topics that will likely make a difference in exam results. The book is NOT intended to guide you through every single official topic.

From a tumbledown converted transmission shop in Ballard, Wash., came Redhook Ale, an offbeat craft beer that was to the brewing business what Starbucks was to coffee: a blast of fresh air, loaded with character and flavor. And little wonder, as both were the brainchild of Gordon Bowkerin Redhook's case, along with Paul Shipman and the whole brew house cast. Red hook cultivated an eccentric image as the maker of an eccentric product, an ale that reviewers at first described as tasting ``like bananas.'' The wild northwest yeast gave it distinction, claimed Redhooks makers; it was the Belgian style they were really after, they claimed. Actually, the yeast was contaminated, but by then they had a following, so why announce their continuous tinkering? Still, tinker they did, finally getting the yeast right with a chemists help, and also going public, the first microb rewer to do so, with a stock offering that shot skyward. The microbrew market has since bottomed out, and Redhook's bohemian image has been tarnished by expansion that robbed it of its handcrafted cachet. Krebs complements the Redhook story with lots of e ntertaining craft brew tidbits (what puts the steam in Anchor, when is a bottom-fermenting beer an ale), but he also creates a godlike aura around both Bowker and Shipman, as if no one else ever had a good idea when it came to fashioning authentic local p roducts that educated the American palate. The early years make the story herea time when food and drink were in as much ferment as Redhook's bitterand Krebs does tell the story with flair.

His latest work (he has written 30 books) has already sold over 500,000 copies in Japan and should be successful in this English edition. Sakaiya easily transcends other works in this genre, such as Alvin Toffler's The Third Wave ( LJ 4/1/80) or Daniel Bell's The Coming of Post-Industrial Society ( LJ 7/73), as he describes a future knowledge-value society. Knowledge-value is \"the price of and the value created by wisdom, and the worth, or price a society gives to that wisdom.\" Massive changes will characterize this brave new world, and Sakaiya describes the three main \"disrupters\" as technological advances, population shifts, and dwindling resources.

A former official at his homeland's redoubtable Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Sakaiya prophesies a brave new postindustrial world in which leisure time and wisdom abound but material as well as human resources are in short supply. In the Arcadian environment he envisions, the mass-produced manufactures that underpin modern consumer societies will yield to goods that somehow combine utility with the equivalent of intelligence and distinctively personal appeal. Unfortunately, the author is decidedly vague as to what constitutes a so-called knowledge-value product, making it almost impossible to gain more than an impression of what the near- and longer-term future might hold--if his predictions come true. Paradoxically, perhaps, Sakaiya's projections are based on notably specific conclusions drawn from selective surveys of Middle Eastern, Oriental, and Western civilizations. The author espouses cyclical theory to the extent that he dwells on instances from the past illustrating how conspicuous consumption gave way to thrift, and materialism to spiritual values. In like vein, Sakaiya makes a persuasive case for the proposition that art and fashion are harbingers of marketplace trends. Of particular interest to US readers who bear with the author's discontinuous critique is his conviction that America's open society is better equipped than that of conformist Japan to capitalize on New Age economics.

The first twopresenting Castro with a toxic wetsuit and supplying his mistress with poison pills (both were actually attempted)fail. The third, providing a disillusioned Castro protege with a rifle (also a real CIA plan) looks the most promising. Oakes is sent to Cuba to help coordinate the uprising that will inevitably follow. Suddenly the CIA discovers that Castro is about to launch a medium-range missile (left from the Cuban missile crisis) at Dallas, Tex., and the president. It's up to Oakes to prevent an escalation of the Cold War. Buckley has abandoned straightforward narration for a series of rapid-fire, cinematic scenes that are sometimes confusing as they jump from Washington, D.C., to Moscow to Havana.
